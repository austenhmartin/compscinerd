Hi! On today's episode we will be discussing one of the most basic data types available for use in the C language - the integer.

Integers, or more colloquially ints, represent, at a minimum, 16 bits of space. 

This allows us to describe data that, in base-10, can be at most 2 to the sixteenth minus 1.

However, if we want to include the possibility of negative numbers, that range is now restricted with the lowest value being negative 1 times two to the sixteenth minus one and the highest integer representable, calculated by subtracting one from two to the sixteenth minus 1.
